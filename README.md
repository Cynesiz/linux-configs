# linux config scripts
Scripted operations that I find myself reusing on a daily basis.

Work in progress, some code is untested, regularly updating. 

I don't suggest that you use these unless you already know what you're doing...

And if you do, I suggest that you glance at the code before executing it, just in case I fucked up.
